# Human Computer Interaction
This is the repository for the code files of the **Human Computer Interaction** lecture at the [Sensing, Interaction and Perception Lab](https://siplab.org) and the [Advanced Interactive Technologies Lab](https://ait.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich taught by Prof. Dr. Christian Holz and Prof. Dr. Otmar Hilliges. The lecture covered the following topics:

Traditional Human Computer Interaction:
- Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction
- User-Centered Design: User Experience (UX), Affordances, Prototyping
- Heuristic Evaluation and Continuous Evaluation
- Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis
- User Modeling: Perception, Cognition, Motor Control; Input Devices

Computational Interaction:
- Input Decoding and Intelligent Text Entry
- Computational Design and Optimization
- Visual Perception, Search, and Attention
- Interactive Output through Haptic Feedback
- Computational Interaction in Mixed Reality

The repository contains a folder with the code to the code of the capstone project, where all of the theoretical knowledge of the lecture had to be applied. # ETH-HumanComputerInteraction
